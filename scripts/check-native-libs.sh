# out. This checks whatever is in that directory, which now means build output.
#
# #469 was the committed liblabwc_android.so three weeks behind its source,
# leaving 51 symbols undefined, so ld.so refused to load it and every
# cage/app-window feature died with
#   dlopen failed: cannot locate symbol "wlr_output_is_drm"
# The app itself was fine; only the binary was bad. Nothing failed until a user
# hit the feature on a device.
#
# Building from source removes the *staleness* half of that and NOT the
# unlinkable half: wlroots is built with -Dbackends=[] and no libinput, so these
# symbols have no real implementation — gen-stubs.sh emits weak stubs for them
# at link time. A fresh build that misses the stubs is just as undlopenable as a
# stale copy was, and just as green at build time. If any of these is UND in a
# shipped library it will not load, and there is no case where shipping one is
# correct — which is what makes this checkable rather than a heuristic.
#
# Consequently this must run AFTER a build. It sat in CI's `checks` job, which
# does not build, and reported "nothing to check" on every run once the
# binaries stopped being committed. It now runs in ci.yml's `build` job and in
# release.yml's build job, both after the Gradle build.

This library will fail to dlopen at runtime (#469). It was almost certainly
linked before wayland-android/gen-stubs.sh ran, or copied from a stale build.

To fix, rebuild from the submodule and copy the result in:
    cd wayland-android && ABI=arm64-v8a ./build_liblabwc_android.sh
    cp wayland-android/jniLibs/<abi>/*.so core/wayland/src/main/jniLibs/<abi>/

Verify before committing:

# These are built from rdp-kotlin/rust by the buildRdpNative Gradle task. The
# task only asked cargo-ndk for arm64-v8a and x86_64 for a long time while all
# three ABIs were checked in, so a Rust change rebuilt two of the then-shipped
# libraries and left armv7 on whatever binary someone last produced by hand.
# The target list is fixed, which stops it recurring; these assertions catch
# the two ways a hand-copied library still goes wrong, and both are things
# that can never legitimately be true of a shipped file:
#
#   * a library placed in the wrong ABI directory — the ELF machine says what
#     it actually is, regardless of the path it sits under
#   * a library built without its JNI entry point, which loads and then fails
#     at the first call with UnsatisfiedLinkError
#
# Deliberately not checked here: whether the binary matches the current Rust
# source. The Gradle task rebuilds both supported ARM ABIs from source,
# so a stale one cannot ship; and a source edit that changes no codegen (a
# comment) would leave nothing to re-commit, so a timestamp comparison would
# fail forever with no way to satisfy it.
